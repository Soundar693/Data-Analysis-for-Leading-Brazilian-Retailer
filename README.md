# Target E-Commerce Data Analysis with Google BigQuery
### Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing e-commerce data for Target to extract valuable business insights and provide actionable recommendations. Using Google BigQuery and advanced SQL techniques, this analysis covers customer behavior, sales trends, delivery efficiency, and economic impact metrics.

### Problem Statement
Assume the role of a Data Analyst at Target. You are tasked with examining a comprehensive e-commerce dataset to uncover trends, understand customer distribution, and recommend data-driven strategies.

### Business Objectives
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on customer and order data.
- Identify trends in orders over time and seasonal patterns.
- Analyze customer ordering habits by time of day.
- Evaluate the geographic distribution of customers.
- Assess financial metrics such as order costs and freight charges.
- Measure delivery performance and speed compared to estimates.
- Examine payment methods and installment-based order patterns.
### Key Analyses & Insights
#### 1. Exploratory Data Analysis
  - Data Types and Structure: Review column data types in the "customers" table.
  - Order Time Range: Calculate the duration over which orders were placed.
  - Customer Locations: Count unique cities and states of customers.
#### 2. Trend Analysis
  - Order Growth: Investigate order trends over the years.
  - Seasonality: Identify monthly variations in order volume.
  - Time-of-Day Insights: Classify Brazilian customer orders by periods (Dawn, Morning, Afternoon, Night).
#### 3. Geographic Distribution
  - State-Wise Orders: Monthly breakdown of orders by state.
  - Customer Distribution: Visualization of customer counts across states.
#### 4. Financial Impact
  - Cost Increase: Percent increase in order costs between Jan-Aug of 2017 and 2018.
  - State-Wise Order Metrics: Total and average order and freight values by state.
#### 5. Delivery Performance
  - Delivery Time Calculation: Compute time to deliver and difference from estimated delivery date.
  - Top 5 States: Highest and lowest average freight values and delivery times.
  - Speed of Delivery: Compare states for faster-than-estimated delivery.
#### 6. Payment Analysis
  - Payment Types: Month-by-month count of orders by payment type.
  - Installments: Number of orders based on payment installments.
Skills Utilized
  - SQL Techniques: CTEs (Common Table Expressions), Conditional Statements, Aggregate Functions, Window Functions, and Joins.
  - Date and Time Functions: Handling complex time-based queries.
Tools and Technologies
  - Google BigQuery: Cloud-based data warehouse for scalable SQL queries.

### Conclusion
This project provides a comprehensive analysis framework for understanding e-commerce patterns and improving operational efficiency at Target. It highlights the power of SQL and BigQuery in solving real-world business problems through data-driven insights.
